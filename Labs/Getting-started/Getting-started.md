# Getting started with the labs

Use the guides in this directory as a starting point to tackle common tasks.

## Cloning the Git Repository

The Labs are located at https://github.com/lfloris/openshift-bootcamp/tree/master/Labs

On your Student X VM, in your home directory, create a new directory for the lab content.

```
$ mkdir awb-bootcamp
```

To clone the whole repo to your local machine, use the following commands
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lfloris/openshift-bootcamp.git awb-bootcamp/
```

This should copy all the labs and any resources to your machine.
